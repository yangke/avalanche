.SH "NAME"
cg_annotate - post-processing tool for Cachegrind
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 12
\fBcg_annotate\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIcachegrind\-out\-file\fR [\fIsource\-files\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcg_annotate\fR
takes an output file produced by the Valgrind tool Cachegrind and prints the information in an easy\-to\-read form\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-h \-\-help \fR
.RS 4
Show the help message\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version \fR
.RS 4
Show the version number\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-show=A,B,C [default: all, using order in cachegrind\.out\.<pid>] \fR
.RS 4
Specifies which events to show (and the column order)\. Default is to use all present in the
\fIcachegrind\.out\.<pid>\fR
file (and use the order in the file)\. Useful if you want to concentrate on, for example, I cache misses (\fB\-\-show=I1mr,ILmr\fR), or data read misses (\fB\-\-show=D1mr,DLmr\fR), or LL data misses (\fB\-\-show=DLmr,DLmw\fR)\. Best used in conjunction with
\fB\-\-sort\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sort=A,B,C [default: order in cachegrind\.out\.<pid>] \fR
.RS 4
Specifies the events upon which the sorting of the function\-by\-function entries will be based\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-threshold=X [default: 0\.1%] \fR
.RS 4
Sets the threshold for the function\-by\-function summary\. A function is shown if it accounts for more than X% of the counts for the primary sort event\. If auto\-annotating, also affects which files are annotated\.
.sp
Note: thresholds can be set for more than one of the events by appending any events for the
\fB\-\-sort\fR
option with a colon and a number (no spaces, though)\. E\.g\. if you want to see each function that covers more than 1% of LL read misses or 1% of LL write misses, use this option:
.sp
\fB\-\-sort=DLmr:1,DLmw:1\fR
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-auto=<no|yes> [default: no] \fR
.RS 4
When enabled, automatically annotates every file that is mentioned in the function\-by\-function summary that can be found\. Also gives a list of those that couldn\'t be found\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-context=N [default: 8] \fR
.RS 4
Print N lines of context before and after each annotated line\. Avoids printing large sections of source files that were not executed\. Use a large number (e\.g\. 100000) to show all source lines\.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-I<dir> \-\-include=<dir> [default: none] \fR
.RS 4
Adds a directory to the list in which to search for files\. Multiple
\fB\-I\fR/\fB\-\-include\fR
options can be given to add multiple directories\.
